# Scripting and Programming - C867

# Project Introduction:
Throughout your career in software development, you will develop and maintain new and existing applications. You will be expected to fix issues as well as add new enhancements or migrate existing applications to new platforms or different programming languages. As a software developer, your role will be to create a design of an application based on given business requirements. After the design is completed, you must implement the application based on the design document and provided requirements.



In this assessment, you will create a C++ application based on the scenario below. The skills you demonstrate in your completed application will be useful in responding to technical interview questions for future employment. 



This project will require an integrated development environment (IDE). You must use either Visual Studio or Xcode for this assessment. Directions for accessing these IDEs can be found in the attached “IDE Instructions.”



Your submission should include a zip file with all the necessary code files to compile, support, and run your application. The zip file submission must also keep the project file and folder structure intact for the Visual Studio IDE or Eclipse IDE.
